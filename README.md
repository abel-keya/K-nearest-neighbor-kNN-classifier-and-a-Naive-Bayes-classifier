# week9_IP_Abel_Keya_K-nearest-neighbor-kNN-classifier-and-a-Naive-Bayes-classifier
This project involves Implementation of  a K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier  and a Naive Bayes classifier. After conducting the experiments the resulting metrics are  calculated 


**Problem statement:**  

conduct the experiments on the two datasets by  Building a K-nearest neighbor (kNN) model classifier  and a Naive Bayes model classifier calculate the resulting metrics

# Context

<p>
   
### Hypothyroidism: (Underactive Thyroid)-Too Little Thyroid Hormone
Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is not able to produce enough thyroid hormone. Since the main purpose of thyroid hormone is to "run the body's metabolism," it is understandable that people with this condition will have symptoms associated with a slow metabolism.
